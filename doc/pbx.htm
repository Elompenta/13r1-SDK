    <h1>The innovaphone PBX system</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        The innovaphone PBX system consists of there major components
        <dl>
            <dt>The PBX</dt>
            <dd>
                The PBX authenticates users, registers Endpoints, provides UC signaling functions
                and grants access to Apps.
            </dd>
            <dt>The myApps Client</dt>
            <dd>
                The myApps client is loaded from the PBX and starts Apps, which are loaded from the PBX
                and also the App Platform. The myApps client provides the login for the user and some
                basic features like presence information. All other features are provided by Apps
            </dd>
            <dt>The App Platform</dt>
            <dd>
                The App Platform hosts App Services, which provide Apps to the myApps client. All
                backend serices for the Apps are implemented there.
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </p>

    <h2>AppWebsocket protocols</h2>
    <p>
        Starting from version 13 the PBX provides interfaces based on Websocket/JSON protocol. A common
        structure is used for authentication an capability exchange. This is called AppWebsocket. Individual
        messages are used for various functions.
    </p>

            <td>
                The AppWebsocket protocol is the used for all communication between the myApps client,
                the App Platform the PBX and the Apps. It is based on Websocket connection and JSON coded
                messages. The AppWebsocket protocol itself defines the basic message structure and some
                basic features like authentication, version control and capability exchange.
                Other features are implemented individually by the instances which use
                this protocol.

    <h2>CDRs</h2>
    <p>
        The PBX creates Call Details records, which may be delivered using several methods. These CDRs
        are XML documents created for individual users/objects of the PBX describing a call as seen by
        this user.
    </p>

    <h2>SOAP-API</h2>
    <p>
        The PBX provides an Api for call-control and administration features with the standard SOAP
        protocol. With a wsdl file this SOAP API can be integrated in many development environment
