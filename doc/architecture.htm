    <h1>Architectural overview</h1>
    <p>
        The innovaphone PBX system consists of there components
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><b><a href="#pbx">PBX</a></b></td>
                <td>
                    The PBX authenticates users, registers Endpoints, provides UC signaling functions
                    and grants access to Apps.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b><a href="#myapps">myApps Client</a></b></td>
                <td>
                    The myApps client is loaded from the PBX and starts Apps, which are loaded from the PBX
                    and also the App Platform. The myApps client provides the login for the user and some
                    basic features like presence information. All other features are provided by Apps
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b><a href="#ap">The App Platform</a></b></td>
                <td>
                    The App Platform hosts App Services, which provide Apps to the myApps client. All
                    backend serices for the Apps are implemented there.
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </p>
    <p>
        Starting from version 13 the PBX provides interfaces based on <b>Websocket/JSON protocol</b>.
        A common structure is used for authentication an capability exchange. This is called AppWebsocket.
        Individual messages are used for various functions.
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><b><a href="appwebsocket/AppWebsocket.htm">AppWebsocket</a></b></td>
                <td>
                    The AppWebsocket protocol is the used for all communication between the myApps client,
                    the App Platform the PBX and the Apps. It is based on Websocket connection and JSON coded
                    messages. The AppWebsocket protocol itself defines the basic message structure and some
                    basic features like authentication, version control and capability exchange.
                    Other features are implemented individually by the instances which use
                    this protocol.

    <h2><a name="pbx">The PBX</a></h2>
    <p>
        PBX objects are used to link the different modules/components of a innovaphone PBX system. There are
        different types used for different purposes
    </p>

    <h3>Table of content</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#pbxobj-ap">AP Object</a></li>
        <li><a href="#pbxobj-app">App Object</a></li>
    </ul>

    <a name="pbxobj-ap"><h3>AP Object</h3></a>
    <p>
        The App Platform (AP) object is used to integrate an AP into a PBX. For this purpose a URL to the
        respective App Platform Manager is stored in the AP object. A shared secret stored in the AP object
        and in the App Platform Manager is used for authentication. There are two types of integration of an
        AP:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Integration as owner</dt>
        <dd>
            For integration as owner of the AP, the shared secret stored in the AP object must also be the
            AP manager instance password, which allows opening of the AP manager. The PBX domain and the
            intance domain must be identical in this case.
        </dd>
        <dt>Service Provider</dt>
        <dd>
            An AP may be used to publish services to other domains. To uses such services, an AP object
            is created to link the AP. A shared secrect stored in the AP for this domain and in the AP
            object is used for authentication.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        The AP object provides the <a href="../web/com.innovaphone.manager/com.innovaphone.manager.htm">com.innovaphone.manager API</a> which is used by the PBX Manager to
        access <a href="../web/com.innovaphone.manager/pbx_manager_plugin.htm">PBX Manager Plugins</a> provided by the AP, which can be used to configure access to
        App Instances provided by the AP.
    </p>
    <p>
        The PBX Manager Plugin APs is used to create the AP object to integrate a AP into the system.
    </p>

    <a name="pbxobj-app"><h3>App Object</h3></a>
    <p>
        An App Object is used to integrate an App Instance in the PBX. For this purpose a URL to the
        respective App Instance is stored in the App object. A shared secret stored in the App object
        and the App instance is used for authentication.
    </p>
    <p>
        By configuration in the App object a permanent Websocket connection from the App object to the App
        instance can be established. This is needed if the App instance needs to access PBX APIs. Which
        PBX APIs are accessible by the App instance is also configured in the App object.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="ap">The App Platform</a></h2>

    <p>
        The innovaphone App Platform is a Linux based system, which may run on a innovaphone gateway
        or in a virtualized PC environment. An App Platform manager allows to install, start, stop and
        update innovaphone App Services.
        <br />
        For an App Service a abstract operating environment is provided, so that App Services can be
        implemented completely operating system independet. For developing an innovaphone App no
        Linux knowlege is needed.
    </p>

    </ul>

    <a name="Manager"><h3>The App Platform Manager</h3></a>
    <p>
        The manager is responsible for managing the App services and instances (see below).
        There is the place where each service and instance can be stopped or started, Apps can be installed
        and removed, backups can be created and restored, the logs of the apps cen be shows, the app itself
        can be configured (Webserver path, database name, ...) and so on.
        The manager is the place to go also to access the innovaphone App Store to download and install
        new apps.
        The manager	also creates a sandbox environment for each app for security reasons. So an app
        can only access and modify their own data.
    </p>

    <a name="Webserver"><h3>The App Platform Webserver</h3></a>
    <p>
        The webserver is the entrance to the world for each app. An app will register itself to the webserver
        buy using an plugin system of the SDK. When registering, the app will use a path which can be accessed
        by a HTTP client. (The path will be defined in the App instance setting inside the Manager).
        There are three types of access the app can register: HTTP, Websocket and Passthrough. HTTP means,
        that under the path to register an client can access HTTP files. This files can
        be static files (statically linked to the app) or dynamic files, the app will build up on runtime.
        Registering as websocket means, that the app will receivie incomming websocket connections.
        And Passthrough gives the full responsibility of the access to the app. So the App needs to know
        what to to with the HTTP protocol, so it is recommended to use passthrough only, if you have to!
    </p>

    <a name="Database"><h3>The App Platform Database</h3></a>
    <p>
        Even if the SDK supports two database systems (mySQL and PostgreSQL), PostgreSQL is the database
        used for the apps. So it is recommended to use it for your application, too.
        The database is not only used for application related data, also the configuration as well as
        files (only when created using  the IDbFiles interface) are stored inside the database.
        Each App instance has it's own database and database connection, which will be shared between
        all of the instances session (see below).
        When creating a backup of an instance, the complete database for that instance will be saved
        and restored, if you're going to restore the backup. This makes creating a Backup of the apps data easy.
    </p>

    <a name="AppService"><h3>The App Service</h3></a>
    <p>
        The App Service ia an in C++ written application running on the App Platform.
        The SDK provides a set of interfaces for everything needed to created an app for the
        innovaphone App Platform. This includes database access, include the app into
        the webserver like a plugin, a HTTP client, sockets, file storage and so on.
    <p>
        It will be managed by the app manager, where an instance of that application will be set up.
        Other instances can be created, too. Because of that mechanism, each App Service must have
        a subclass of AppService. There, the AppService::CreateInstance()
        must be implemented to return a new instance SubClass of AppInstance, each time the CreateInstance()
        function will be called. And the AppInstance itself needs to create an instance of subclass
        of AppSession each time an incomming websocket
        request from a new UI session comes in. The procedure is as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The manager loads the app into the memory.
            </li>
            <li>
                The app creates an AppService, which will report to the manager, that the app had been loaded.
            </li>
            <li>
                The manager now sends a message to the app to create an instance of AppInstance.
            </li>
            <li>
                The created AppInstance will start to listen to incoming websocket request.
            </li>
            <li>
                If a websocket request for a new session comes in, the AppInstance will create an instance
                of an AppSession and assigns the websocket connection to that instance.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        So finally, each app has only one AppService instance, which is the part of the app that communicates
        with the Manager. It also is responsible to create the AppInstance, the manager calls to create
        (depending how many app	instances had been configured). The AppInstance itself is responsible
        for listening to incomming websocket requests and create a AppSession for each websocekt connection
        that comes from an Apps JavaScript UI. That	AppSession is the core of the application, because it
        handles the user input, sent from the UI to the session, returns results, reads and writes from and
        to the database, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        The App Platform Manager can start multiple instances within an App Service, to support different
        configurations or even different customers. The different Instances run within the same process
        context.
    </p>

    <a name="App"><h3>The App</h3></a>
    <p>
        The App is the component, which runs in the myApps client. It is written in Javascript. Of course
        an App typically needs an backend service to provide useful functionality, so the App is mostly just
        the User Interface.
    </p>
    <p>
        To create the UI, the SDK provides some JavaScript files that handles all of the App Service / App
        communcation. This communication happens over the websocket connection, sending JSON messages
        back an forth. So the AppSession needs to implement the messages it will receive from and send
        to the UI, while the UI must handle the same messages, too. The SDK also provides some base and
        extended JavaScript UI controls, as well as everything needed to localize the
        app and use the themes of the innovaphone App Client. But the developer still needs knowledge
        of JavaScript and HTML to create the UI.
    </p>
    <p>
        The files for that UI will be linked as static files into the binary of the App Service.
        Each request to one of those files will be handled automatically by the IWebserverPlugin,
        so the App Service itself do't need to handled that by itself. The good side effect
        of this is, that no one can change the files because there are not sotred seperatly on an hard disk.
